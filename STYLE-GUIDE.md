# General guidelines

## Release notes

If possible, a release note should link to the documentation page of the related feature. For each release note, try to
give an example of its use case, and only go into technical detail when necessary.

### Features

Release notes for new features should convey clearly what functionality has been introduced, and how this functionality 
can be used.

Any required steps to use new functionality either go in the migration section if it is a one time action, or should
be listed on a separate page describing the feature so that people can find the usage in later versions.

## Introductions

Every page under the sections 'Introduction', 'Using Valtimo', and 'Extending Valtimo' should contain an introductory
paragraph at the top of the page. Try to mention use cases in this introduction. Under other sections, assess on a
case-by-case basis whether a page should contain an introduction.

## Screenshots

Adding screenshots is useful when writing instructions. All text contained in the screenshot should be in English.
Preferably show screenshots from the default Valtimo implementation, and remember to keep all screenshots up-to-date.
