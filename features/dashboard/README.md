# ðŸ“Š Dashboard

The dashboard is used to display useful information to Valtimo users at a glance. Dashboards can provide the user with statistical information. Using this information, the user will be enabled to prioritize and focus on specific tasks.

A dashboard contains a set of widgets that display data in a customised way. These dashboards and widgets can be configured by an administrator accordingly.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Concepts**

* **Dashboard** A container for any number of widgets. Multiple dashboards can be configured, which will be shown to the user as tabs.
* **Widget** Presents data from a datasource using a display-type to the user.
* **Data-source** Every dashboard widget retrieves its data from a data-source.
* **Display-type** A display type is responsible for the visualisation of data. For example: bar char, big number, meter, gauge, or any custom. Display types are only available for data-sources that return the required data.
{% endhint %}

## Creating a dashboard

There are two ways of configuring dashboards:

* Manually via the UI
* Using auto-deployment via the IDE

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Via UI" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
Configuring dashboards requires:

* Admin privileges
{% endhint %}

* Go to the `Admin` menu
* Go to the `Dashboard` menu
* Click on **Add new dashboard**
* Fill in the form

![admin-dashboard-configuration.png](../../.gitbook/assets/admin-dashboard-configuration.png) ![add-new-dashboard.png](../../.gitbook/assets/add-new-dashboard.png)

When creating a dashboard, two fields need to be filled in:

* The 'Dashboard name' will be shown to the user on the dashboard page.
* The 'Description' field is only visible for the system administrator. It will not be shown to the end users.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Via IDE" %}
Dashboards can be auto-deployed from a json file at startup. This is useful to keep the dashboard configuration identical across multiple environments. Dashboards are auto-deployed by scanning files on the classpath that end in `.dashboard.json`.

**Changesets**

Every deployment file for represents a changeset. These files are required to contain a changesetId that should be unique over all deployment files that use changesets. When starting up, changesets that have already been executed will be ignored. A checksum of the changeset is created when it is executed. Changesets that have already been deployed should not change. Changesets that have been changed since a previous time will result in an error and failure to start the application.

All changesets can be executed again, even when the content has changed, by setting the `valtimo.changelog.dashboard.clear-tables` property to `true`.

**Example**

You can find an example of the JSON below.

In this example a widget is created with display type `number` and data source `case-count`. Different [display types](widget-display-types.md) and [data sources](dashboard.md) can be used to customize the layout of the dashboard.

```json
{
  "changesetId": "example-dashboard-v1",
  "dashboards": [
    {
      "key": "example-dashboard",
      "title": "Dashboard",
      "description": "This is an example dashboard",
      "order": 1,
      "widgetConfigurations": [
        {
          "key": "nr_of_cases_awaiting_customer_feedback",
          "title": "Nr of cases awaiting customer feedback",
          "dataSourceKey": "case-count",
          "dataSourceProperties": {
            "documentDefinition": "generic-case-type",
            "queryConditions": [
              {
                "queryPath": "doc:status",
                "queryOperator": "==",
                "queryValue": "AWAITING_FEEDBACK"
              }
            ]
          },
          "displayType": "number",
          "displayTypeProperties": {
            "title": "Nr of cases awaiting customer feedback",
            "subtitle": "Of type ",
            "label": null,
            "useKPI": true,
            "lowSeverityThreshold": 25,
            "mediumSeverityThreshold": 50,
            "highSeverityThreshold": 75
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Adding widgets

After creating a dashboard, widgets can be added to the dashboard.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Via UI" %}
* Go to the `Admin` menu
* Go to the `Dashboard` menu
* Click the dashboard that needs to be configured
* Click on **Add new widget**
* Fill in the form

![admin-widget-configuration.png](../../.gitbook/assets/admin-widget-configuration.png) ![add-new-widget.png](../../.gitbook/assets/add-new-widget.png)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Widgets can also be configured via a JSON editor:

{% widgets %}
{% widgets title="Via JSON editor" %}

- Go to the `Admin` menu
- Go to the `Dashboards` menu
- Select a dashboard
- Click on **The code icon**
- Click on **Edit**
- Configure a new widget, delete a widget or edit an existing widget
- Click **Save**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/admin-widget-configuration-json-editor-active.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This allows for faster editing of widgets or exchanging different dashboard widgets configurations throughout different environments.

## Access control

Access to dashboards can be configured through access control. More information about access control can be found [here](https://docs.valtimo.nl/features/access-control).
