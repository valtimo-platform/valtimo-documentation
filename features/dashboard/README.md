# ðŸ“Š Dashboard

The dashboard is used to display useful information to Valtimo users at a glance. Dashboards can provide the user with statistical information. Using this information, the user will be enabled to prioritize and focus on specific tasks.

A dashboard contains a set of widgets that display data in a customized way. These dashboards and widgets can be configured by an administrator accordingly.

## Concepts

* **Dashboard** A container for any number of widgets. Multiple dashboards can be configured, which will be shown to the user as tabs.
* **Widget** Presents data from a datasource using a display-type to the user.
* **Data-source** Every dashboard widget retrieves its data from a data-source.
* **Display-type** A display type is responsible for the visualisation of data. For example: bar char, big number, meter, gauge, or any custom. Display types are only available for data-sources that return the required data.

This section contains instructions on how to configure the dashboard.
