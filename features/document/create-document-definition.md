# ðŸ›‘ Creating a document definition

A document definition is a JSON document that defines the structure that document has, as well as restrict the allowed values for each property through validation rules. This page shows how to create a document definition, and how to add validation to properties. How to create a process with a document can be found [here](start-case.md).

### Prerequisites

This page requires you to have knowledge of JSON schema.

## Definition

### Via the project

To create a document definition, the following steps are necessary:

*   Create a document definition file (ending with `.schema.json`) under the following path: `*/resources/config/document/definition`. The name should correspond with the ID of the document ID. The ID itself should end with `.schema`.

    **`person.schema.json`**

    ```json
    {
      "$id": "person.schema",
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "title": "Person",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
      }
    }
    ```
*   Properties as well as validation rules can be added to the definition as per the JSON schema standard as seen [here](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/index.html). Below is an example of what this definition could look like.

    ```json
    {
      "$id": "person.schema",
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "title": "Person",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "firstName": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The person's first name.",
          "maxLength": 15
        },
        "age": {
          "description": "Age in years which must be equal to or greater than zero.",
          "type": "integer",
          "minimum": 0
        },
        "birthday": {
          "description": "Birthday",
          "type": "string",
          "format": "date"
        },
        "hasPet": {
          "description": "Has pet.",
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Via the admin interface

As an alternative to creating a document definition in the project, a document definition can also be created via the admin interface. Creating the file itself is identical, but the path is not important as it will be uploaded to Valtimo.

* Go to the Admin menu.
* Go to the Cases menu.
* Press create.
* Enter the title, and optionally edit the name.
* Save the document definition. This takes you to the document definition overview.
* Press edit.
* Edit the document definition as per the JSON schema standard.
* Press save.

### Uploading a document definition

Another alternative to creating a document definition in the project is to upload a document definition via the admin interface. Creating the file itself is identical, but the path is not important as it will be uploaded to Valtimo.

* Go to the Admin menu
* Go to the Cases menu
* Click on Upload case-definition.
* Upload the document definition.
