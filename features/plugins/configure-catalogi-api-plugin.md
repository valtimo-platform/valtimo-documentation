# Catalogi API plugin

{% hint style="success" %}
The Catalogi API plugin is a ZGW plugin and can only be used in the GZAC edition.
{% endhint %}

The Catalogi API plugin can be used to access data stored in a ZGW (zaakgericht werken) catalogue. This is based on the Catalogi API standard created and used by the Dutch government.

## Configure the plugin

A plugin configuration is required before the plugin can be used. A general description on how to configure plugins can be found [here](broken-reference/).

If the Catalogi API plugin is not visible in the plugin menu, it is possible the application is missing a dependency. Instructions on how to add the Catalogi API dependency can be found [here](../../fundamentals/getting-started/modules/zgw/catalogi-api.md).

To configure this plugin the following properties have to be entered:

* **URL (`url`).** Contains the complete base URL of the Catalogi API to connect to. This generally includes the path `/api/v1/`.
* **Authentication plugin configuration (`authenticationPluginConfiguration`).** Reference to another plugin configuration that will be used to add authentication to any request performed on the Catalogi API. If no option is available in this field a plugin has to be configured that is able to authenticate for the specific application that hosts the Catalogi API. (e.g. OpenZaak)

## Available actions

The Catalogi API plugin supports the following actions that can be configured in process links in order to retrieve type data.

A general description on how to create process links can be found [here](broken-reference/).

### Retrieve statustypen

This action retrieves the statustypen collection containing the name and URL of the statustype and will assign it to a process variable.

When creating a process link the following properties have to be entered:

* **Process variable name**. This is the name of the process variable which value will be set to the found statustypen collection.
* **Zaaktype URL** (optional). This is the URL of the zaaktype for which the statustypen should be retrieved.

### Retrieve statustype

This action retrieves the statustype URL using the statustype description, and will assign it to a process variable.

When creating a process link the following properties have to be entered:

*   **Statustype**. This description will be used to lookup the full statustype URL

    A full URL can also be set here. In that case, the value will be used directly without a lookup.
* **Process variable name**. This is the name of the process variable which value will be set to the found statustype URL.

### Retrieve resultaattypen

This action retrieves a list of resultaattypen (containing the name and URL of each resultaattype) and will assign it to a process variable.

When creating a process link the following properties have to be entered:

* **Process variable name**. This is the name of the process variable which value will be set to the found resultaattypen collection.
* **Zaaktype URL** (optional). This is the URL of the zaaktype for which the resultaattypen should be retrieved.

### Retrieve resultaattype

This action retrieves the resultaattype URL using the resultaattype description, and will assign it to a process variable.

When creating a process link the following properties have to be entered:

*   **Resultaattype**. This description will be used to lookup the full resultaattype URL

    A full URL can also be set here. In that case, the value will be used directly without a lookup.
* **Process variable name**. This is the name of the process variable which value will be set to the found resultaattype URL.

### Retrieve besluittype

This action retrieves the besluittype URL using the besluittype description, and will assign it to a process variable.

When creating a process link the following properties have to be entered:

*   **Besluittype**. This description will be used to lookup the full besluittype URL

    A full URL can also be set here. In that case, the value will be used directly without a lookup.
* **Process variable name**. This is the name of the process variable which value will be set to the found besluittype URL.
