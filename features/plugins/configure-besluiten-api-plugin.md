# Besluiten Plugin

The Besluiten API plugin is used to store information about besluiten (decisions) in an application that supports the Besluiten API standard created and used by the Dutch government.

## Configure the plugin

A plugin configuration is required before the plugin can be used. A general description on how to configure plugins can be found [here](configure-plugin.md).

If the Besluiten API plugin is not visible in the plugin menu, it is possible the application is missing a dependency. Instructions on how to add the Besluiten API dependency can be found [here](../../nog-een-plek-geven/modules/zgw/besluiten-api.md).

To configure this plugin the following properties have to be entered:

* **URL.** Contains the complete base URL of the Besluiten API to connect to. This generally includes the path `/api/v1/`.
* **Authentication plugin configuration.** Reference to another plugin configuration that will be used to add authentication to any request performed on the Besluiten API. If no option is available in this field a plugin has to be configured that is able to authenticate for the specific application that hosts the Besluiten API.
