# Object Token Auhentication Plugin

The Object Token Authentication plugin is used to provide authentication for ZGW (Zaakgericht Werken) plugins that connect to APIs which use a token as authentication. Currently, the plugins that this plugin can provide authentication for are the following:

* [Objecten API](configure-objecten-api-plugin.md)
* [Objecttypen API](configure-objecttypen-api-plugin.md)

### Prerequisites

This page requires you to have knowledge on how to configure Objecten API.

## Configuring the plugin

A plugin configuration is required before the plugin can be used. A general description on how to configure plugins can be found [here](broken-reference).

If the Object Token Auhentication plugin is not visible in the plugin menu, it is possible the application is missing a dependency. Instructions on how to add the Objecten API authentication dependency can be found [here](../../fundamentals/getting-started/modules/zgw/objecten-api-authentication.md).

To configure this plugin the following properties have to be entered:

* **Token (`token`).** The token is configured in the Objects administration page 'api authorizations'. The token should have permissions to object(types) registered to it.
