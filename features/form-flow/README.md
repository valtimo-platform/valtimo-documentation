# ðŸ”€ Form flow

Form flow allows users to create a sequence of forms, similar to a flow chart or form wizard. A form flow definition contains the configuration for each step, what the subsequent steps are, and the conditions under which they can be reached. A form flow can be linked to a task, which consequently allows for more forms for the same task. Form flow supports forwards and backwards movement between steps without completing the task, reducing complexity in a BPMN model.

Form flow offers a way to configure a flow between different Form IO forms inside the same user task.

This section contains information on how to configure and use Flow flows.
