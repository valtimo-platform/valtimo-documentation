# Form.io widget

## Configure widget

For the Form.io widget there's only two fields that need to be configured:

* **Widget title**\
  _The widget title is presented in the UI at the top-left corner of the widget and should describe the content for that widget._
*   **Form.io form**\
    _A dropdown is available with all Form.io definitions that are available in the implementation_

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Color tokens:

For the Form.io forms to be properly displayed in both normal and high contrast widgets, some custom CSS adjustments might be necessary. Form.io text should use the Carbon color tokens instead of regular hex values. For example:

```
color: var(--cds-text-primary)
```
{% endhint %}
