# What are dashboards

Dashboards can provide the user with statistical information.
Using this information, the user will be enabled to prioritize and focus on specific tasks.

A dashboard contains a set of widgets that display data in a customized way. 
These dashboards and widgets can be configured by an administrator accordingly.

## Concepts

* **Dashboard** A container for any number of widgets. 
    Multiple dashboards can be configured, which will be shown to the user as tabs.
* **Widget** Presents data from a datasource using a display-type to the user.
* **Data-source** Retrieves data from any desired source. 
    Every datasource can publish output features like `value`, `total` or `values`.
* **Display-type** A display type is responsible for the visualisation of data. 
    For example: bar char, big number, meter, gauge, or any custom. 
    Display types are strictly available for datasources that publish the required features
