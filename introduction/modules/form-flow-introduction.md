# Form flow

Form flow allows users to create a sequence of forms, similar to a flow chart or form wizard. A form flow definition
contains the configuration for each step, what the subsequent steps are, and the conditions under which they can be
reached. A form flow can be linked to a task, which consequently allows for more forms for the same task. Form flow
supports forwards and backwards movement between steps without completing the task, reducing complexity in a BPMN model.
