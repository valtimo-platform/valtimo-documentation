# What are form links

Form links are the link between forms and BPMN activities. When a user task or start event is
reached as part of a process, the configured form can be opened and completed.


## Supported form types

* **Form definition.** Connects the user task to a form definition included in the application.

* **Form flow definition.** Connects the user task or start event to a form flow definition included in the application.

* **Internal route.** Connects the user task or start event to a custom Angular form in the application.

* **External URL.** Connects the user task or start event to an external web form.
