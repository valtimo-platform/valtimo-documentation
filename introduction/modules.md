## Plugins

Plugins are extensions on the Valtimo platform. These are often connections to external
services, such as transactional email and  generating documents. Some plugins are provided
by the platform, but developers can create their own plugins as well. Plugins can be 
configured without writing code, and can be used during BPMN processes.
