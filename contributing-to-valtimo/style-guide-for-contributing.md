# Documentation

The Valtimo product team aims to deliver new functionality to its users quickly. Contributions from outside the core development team are very much appreciated and welcomed. Part of making a contribution to Valtimo is writing clear and accessible documentation.&#x20;

## Writing documentation

There are two different circumstances for which documentation for Valtimo can be written.&#x20;

* Either because it is related to a particular change in the product that will be included in an upcoming release.&#x20;
* Or to add something that is not related to an upcoming release, e.g. fixing spelling errors or documenting part of an already existing feature.

### Documentation related to an upcoming release <a href="#writing-documentation-related-to-an-upcoming-release" id="writing-documentation-related-to-an-upcoming-release"></a>

1. Write documentation/release notes. These should be written as a PR for [this repository](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-documentation/tree/main).&#x20;
   * Information on what language to use, as well as general guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-documentation/blob/story/restructure-docs/contributing/style-guide/README.md).
   * Release notes to in the `release-notes` package.
   * If new pages are added, these should also be added to `SUMMARY.md`. The sidebar shown on GitBook corresponds to this structure.
   * It is required to fork the repository to implement the changes and create the PR.
2. The Valtimo team will merge the PR after approval.

### Documentation unrelated to an upcoming release <a href="#writing-documentation-unrelated-to-an-upcoming-release" id="writing-documentation-unrelated-to-an-upcoming-release"></a>

1. In case of a new page, discuss the documentation you want to write with someone from the Valtimo team.
2. Write documentation. This should be written as a PR for [this repository](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-documentation). Make a branch from the `main` branch, add all [team Valtimo developers](https://github.com/orgs/valtimo-platform/teams/valtimo-product-team/members) to this PR as reviewers.
3. Merge the branch after getting an approval from the Valtimo team.

### Release notes

If possible, a release note should link to the documentation page of the related feature. For each release note, try to give an example of its use case, and only go into technical detail when necessary.

#### Features

Release notes for new features should convey clearly what functionality has been introduced, and how this functionality can be used.

Any required steps to use new functionality either go in the migration section if it is a one time action, or should be listed on a separate page describing the feature so that people can find the usage in later versions.

### Introductions

Every page under the sections 'Introduction', 'Using Valtimo', and 'Extending Valtimo' should contain an introductory paragraph at the top of the page. Try to mention use cases in this introduction. Under other sections, assess on a case-by-case basis whether a page should contain an introduction.

### Screenshots

Adding screenshots is useful when writing instructions. All text contained in the screenshot should be in English. Preferably show screenshots from the default Valtimo implementation, and remember to keep all screenshots up-to-date.

### External references

When including a reference to an external source, a link to the external documentation should be included when possible.
