# Extending Valtimo

This section contains instructions and examples on how to extend functionality found in Valtimo, generally through the 
use of code. These are usually features that have been set up in a way so that the default functionality can be easily 
extended. For example, here you can find how to set up a custom FormFieldDataResolver to preload data in forms from 
external sources.

This section is intended for people who want to get more out of Valtimo and are able to write Java or Kotlin code.
