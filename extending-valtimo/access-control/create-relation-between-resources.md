# Creating a relation to another resource

When setting conditions for a permission you sometimes want those conditions to apply to related resources. For example,
you might want to view tasks for cases that have not yet been assigned. In this case the not assigned part do not apply
directly to the task, but to the related case resource. To define conditions on related resources there first has to be 
a relation that Valtimo can use to base its logic on. This page describes how to create a relation from one resource 
to another.

## How to create a mapper

In order to support conditions on a related entity an implementation of `AuthorizationEntityMapper` needs to be created.
This will tell Valtimo how to access the related data. Two different ways of accessing the data are supported for two
scenarios.

- When requesting a list of the primary resource with a condition on the related resource, the SQL query will have to be
  changed to allows for filtering on a database level and proper pagination. The `mapQuery` method should use criteria 
  query logic to join the related table.
- When checking access based on a single entity that has already been retrieved the related entity needs to be found.
  The `mapRelated` method should return the related objects based on a given entity. This can either be done by
  calling a service or repository to find the entity, or when the primary resource has a JPA relation by simply 
  accessing the corresponding property.

For example, if you have a related custom entity `Meeting` that belong to a Document the following code could be used.

```kotlin

class Meeting {
  ...
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name="document_id", nullable=false)
  lateinit var document: JsonSchemaDocument
  ...
}

class MeetingDocumentMapper() : AuthorizationEntityMapper<Meeting, JsonSchemaDocument> {

  override fun mapRelated(entity: Meeting): List<JsonSchemaDocument> {
    // since meeting has a direct relation to document, we can directly return
    return listOf(entity.document)
  }

  override fun mapQuery(
    root: Root<Meeting>,
    query: CriteriaQuery<*>,
    criteriaBuilder: CriteriaBuilder
  ): AuthorizationEntityMapperResult<JsonSchemaDocument> {
    val documentRoot = query.from(JsonSchemaDocument::class.java)
    return AuthorizationEntityMapperResult(
      documentRoot,
      query,
      criteriaBuilder.equal(root.get<Meeting>("document"), documentRoot.get<JsonSchemaDocumentId>("id").get<UUID>("id"))
    )
  }

  override fun supports(fromClass: Class<*>, toClass: Class<*>): Boolean {
    // this mapper is only used to map from Meeting to JsonSchemaDocument
    return fromClass == Meeting::class.java && toClass == JsonSchemaDocument::class.java
  }
}
```

## How to configure conditions for a related resource

In order to configure conditions for a related resource, a mapper needs to exist that can map from the primary resource 
to the related resource. Some mappers come packaged with Valtimo. Which mappers these are can be found on the 
[reference page](/reference/modules/authorization.md).

When a mapper exists to another resource a condition of type container can be used to nest conditions on the related 
resource. This condition has a conditions array that can be used to define conditions that apply to the related resource.

If for example we wanted users with role `ROLE_USER` to only be able to view meetings for Documents that are assigned to 
them, the following configuration can be used.

```json
{
    "resourceType": "com.ritense.example.Meeting",
    "action": "view",
    "roleKey": "ROLE_USER",
    "conditionContainer": {
        "conditions": [
            {
                "type": "container",
                "resourceType": "com.ritense.document.domain.impl.JsonSchemaDocument",
                "conditions": [
                    {
                        "type": "field",
                        "field": "assigneeId",
                        "operator": "==",
                        "value": "${currentUserId}"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
