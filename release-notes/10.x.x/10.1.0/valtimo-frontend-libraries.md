# Valtimo frontend libraries

## New Features

The following features were added:

*   **Improved error messages in popup**

    The popup showing the error messages has been improved in several ways:

    * It now more often shows the details of the error.
    * It now more often shows a reference ID of the error.
    * When the popup is clicked, it won't disappear. Making it easier to copy the error from the popup.
*   **Supporting process title translatable**

    The option to translate subprocess title is now added. A new key with the value of the `processDefinitionKey` can be used in the translation file to override the default.
