# 13.1.2

## Bugfixes

* Improved the migration script for migrating Camunda web-app roles to the corresponding Operaton web-app roles. The 
application should no longer break when starting up when those Operaton web-app roles were already present before 
running the migration.

## Features

### Open Dossiers in a New Tab

Support has been introduced for the standard browser interaction **Ctrl/Cmd + click**, enabling users to open cases from
lists or links in a new browser tab. The existing behavior for a regular click remains unchanged.
