# 13.2.0

## New Features

#### Direct navigation from a task to associated case

In the Task modal opened from the Task list, a folder details icon is now displayed. Selecting this icon opens the associated case in a new tab.

#### Value path selector is

The case definition dropdown has been removed to simplify the configuration of document definition names. The value path selector behavior now adapts to the context:

* Inside a Case: The case definition dropdown has been removed. Users can directly choose a path from the current case, either by selecting from the available paths in the dropdown or by entering it manually.

* Outside a Case: The Value Path Selector is replaced with a simple text input field for manual entry. In this context, the toggle between dropdown and input field is no longer available.
