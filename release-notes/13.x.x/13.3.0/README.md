## New Features

* **Add Case Objects to Case** &#x20;

You can now add case objects directly to an existing Case enhancement through the Zaken API Plugin. This new plugin action makes it simple to link extra information or related items to a case as part of a workflow task. It helps ensure that all relevant details stay organized and easily accessible within the same case.

* **Enhanced “Create Case” Plugin Action**&#x20;

The “Create Case” plugin action has been improved to allow users to fill in more case details when creating a new case in Open Zaak. Previously, only the required fields were included when a case was created. With this update, additional (optional) fields can now be completed, making it easier to register cases with all the relevant information right from the start.

## Bugfixes

* Case documents now loading and opening more quickly.
* Task statuses are fully visible and easy to read and understand.
* The issue with the not loading General Information screen is resolved.
* The issue with getProcessDefinitionKey is fixed.
* Migration issue _with Request Plugin_ is resolved.
