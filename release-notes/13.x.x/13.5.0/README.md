* **Improved Notificaties API logging**

When an abonnement cannot be registered or updated with the Notificaties API, additional information is provided on what went wrong.

* **OpenZaak-plugin updates**

The OpenZaak-plugin is now updated with the new action allowing to remove the Zaak-role once the role is no longer available

The Case widgets now have a new widget type provided out of the box: Interactive table. This allows defining actions such as redirecting to a link on row click or via a button in a table toolbar.
