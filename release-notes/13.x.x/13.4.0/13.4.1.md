## Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue where the Documenten filter in the case detail view was misaligned, appearing too far to the right and causing part of the filter menu to display with background transparency. The filter is now correctly positioned and fully visible
* Fixed an issue where the application would fail to start because the Verzoek plugin mapping validation was done before the case definition deployment.
