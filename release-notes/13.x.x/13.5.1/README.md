# 13.5.1

## Enhancements

* **Sanitization of document titles** in the doccumenten-api-metadata-modal has been simplified. We no longer remove all symbols and punctuation. Now we will only remove the file extension and replace all underscores and dots with spaces.

## Bugfixes

* Radio button options now display horizontally when selecting Inline Layout in Form.io. The label spacing for radio buttons is also now consistent with other form elements.
