# 13.1.2

## New features
### Retry cycles for failed jobs
Standard Retry cycles are defined which can be add to the following BPMN elements:
 * Tasks
 * Call Activities
 * Sub processes
 * Events

The following retry cycles are available:
* DEFAULT = R3/PT1M,PT30M,PT2H
* QUICK = R3/PT30S,PT2M,PT10M
* CRITICAL = R5/PT1M,PT15M,PT4H,PT24H,PT48H
* DATABASE = R4/PT10S,PT1M,PT5M,PT15M // For connection/lock issues
* EMAIL = R3/PT5M,PT20M,PT1H // For SMTP delivery issues
* WEB_SERVICE = R4/PT30S,PT3M,PT8M,PT10M // For HTTP timeouts/5xx errors
* FILE_TRANSFER = R3/PT1M,PT15M,PT1H // For upload/download issues

These retry cycles can be overridden in application.yml. Furthermore, custom cycles can be added
using the Spring Boot config files.

see more about it [here](../../features/process/retry-cycle.md)

## Security improvements

* A security advisory has been published [here](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-w48j-pp7j-fj55).
  Users with administrator privileges had access to unnecessary resources through the scripting engine available in
  processes. In order to restrict this, a whitelist has been added to Valtimo, which by default only allows access to a
  small number of methods and classes in the scripting engine. Further details can be found in the security advisory.

## Bugfixes

* Improved the migration script for migrating Camunda web-app roles to the corresponding Operaton web-app roles. The
  application should no longer break when starting up when those Operaton web-app roles were already present before
  running the migrating.
