# 13.1.2

## Security improvements

* A security advisory has been published [here](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-w48j-pp7j-fj55).
  Users with administrator privileges had access to unnecessary resources through the scripting engine available in
  processes. In order to restrict this, a whitelist has been added to Valtimo, which by default only allows access to a
  small number of methods and classes in the scripting engine. Further details can be found in the security advisory.

## Bugfixes

* Improved the migration script for migrating Camunda web-app roles to the corresponding Operaton web-app roles. The
  application should no longer break when starting up when those Operaton web-app roles were already present before
  running the migrating.
