# 13.1.2

## New features
### Retry cycles for failed jobs
Standard Retry cycles are defined which can be add to the following BPMN elements:
 * Tasks
 * Call Activities
 * Sub processes
 * Events

The following retry cycles are available:
* DEFAULT = R3/PT1M,PT30M,PT2H
* QUICK = R3/PT30S,PT2M,PT10M
* CRITICAL = R5/PT1M,PT15M,PT4H,PT24H,PT48H
* DATABASE = R4/PT10S,PT1M,PT5M,PT15M // For connection/lock issues
* EMAIL = R3/PT5M,PT20M,PT1H // For SMTP delivery issues
* WEB_SERVICE = R4/PT30S,PT3M,PT8M,PT10M // For HTTP timeouts/5xx errors
* FILE_TRANSFER = R3/PT1M,PT15M,PT1H // For upload/download issues

These retry cycles can be customized in application.yml.
In addition, custom cycles can be defined through Spring Boot configuration files.

see more about it [here](../../features/process/retry-cycle.md)

## Security improvements

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Breaking Change**

As part of the security improvements, scripting in processes is now restricted by a whitelist. If your application uses custom scripting classes, you may need to whitelist them explicitly.
{% endhint %}

* A security advisory has been published [here](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-w48j-pp7j-fj55).
* Users with administrator privileges previously had access to unnecessary resources through the scripting engine in processes.
* To mitigate this, Valtimo now restricts scripting access by default, allowing only a limited set of methods and classes.

For migration details, see: [Whitelisting Scripting classes](../../features/process/process/whitelist-scripting-classes.md).

## Bugfixes

* Improved the migration script for migrating Camunda web-app roles to the corresponding Operaton web-app roles. The application should no longer break when starting up when those Operaton web-app roles were already present before running the migrating.
