# 13.3.0

**BUG FIXES**:

* Fixed an issue in migrating on a MySQL database, where process links could not be migrated properly.
* Fixed an issue in migrating process definitions, where process definitions with subprocesses that have call 
activities could not be migrated properly.
* Fixed an issue where after creating a draft from an existing case definition, the version tags in process 
definitions would still point to the previous case definition version. 
* Fixed an issue where when migrating a process definition to a number of case definitions, the version tags were not set 
properly.
* Fixed an issue where during deployment of a global process definition, previous version could be deleted, including the 
corresponding deployment.
* Version tag is now properly taken into account when creating a case-specific process from a process that is not
linked to a case definition.
* Fixed an issue where Keycloak users with duplicate usernames could not be migrated correctly in Valtimo.
