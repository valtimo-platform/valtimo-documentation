# 13.3.0

**BUG FIXES**:

* Process links are now migrated properly on a MySQL database.
* Process definitions with subprocesses containing call activities will now be migrated properly.
* When creating a case definition draft from an existing case definition, the version tags will now be set properly in 
process definitions.
* Migrating a process definition to a number of case definitions will now set the version tags properly.
* When deploying a global process definition, previous versions of that process definition and their deployment 
will no longer be deleted.
