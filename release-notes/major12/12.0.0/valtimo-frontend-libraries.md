# Frontend libraries 12.0.0

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Form flow management**

  An administrator can now see, create and edit form flows from a front-end admin page. For more information on form
  flows, refer to [this page](/using-valtimo/form-flow/create-form-flow-definition.md).

* **Inline edit document definition**

  Document definition can now be edited inline to create a new version.

* **Pending changes modal extension**

  The pending changes modal has been extended to accept custom modals. An example of this use would be a pending changes modal for an 'Edit mode' function, where you might want to have three buttons (e.g. *Keep editing*, *Save*, *Discard*) instead of the two buttons that are offered out of the box.

  More details about the PendingChangesComponent can be found [here](/using-valtimo/pending-changes/pending-changes.md)

* **Creating document definitions via the admin interface**

  A document definition can now be created via the admin interface. This is an alternative to creating a document
  definition in the project, which enables the user to create a document definition without needing to create a file in
  the project.

  More details about creating document definitions can be found [here](/using-valtimo/document/create-document-definition.md)

* **Zaken-api plugin action start and end Hersteltermijn**

  A Zaken-API plugin action has been added for both starting and ending a recovery period.

  More information about the plugin actions can be
  found [here](/using-valtimo/plugin/zaken-api/configure-zaken-api-plugin.md#start-recovery-period).
