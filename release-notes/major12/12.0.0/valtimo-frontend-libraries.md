# Frontend libraries x.x.x

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Inline edit document definition**

  Document definition can now be edited inline to create a new version.

* **Pending changes modal extension**

  The pending changes modal has been extended to accept custom modals. An example of this use would be a pending changes modal for an 'Edit mode' function, where you might want to have three buttons(e.g. *Keep editing*, *Save*, *Discard*) instead of the out of the box two.
