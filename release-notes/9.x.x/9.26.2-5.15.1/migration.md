# Migration

This page describes how to update Valtimo from the previous version to the current.

*   **Change Swagger to OpenAPI**

    Scope: Front-end

    The `/v2/api-docs` has been replaced by `/v3/api-docs`. This new path should be set in the environment.ts:

    ```javascript
    swagger: {
      endpointUri: '/v3/api-docs'
    }
    ```
