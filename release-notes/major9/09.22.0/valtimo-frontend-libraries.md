# Frontend libraries 5.11.0 (RC)

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **New Documenten API Form.IO upload component**

  A new custom Form.IO component has been added to upload one file at a time, with a modal to input metadata for the
  Documenten API. The component can be inserted into a Form.IO form after following [these instructions](/using-valtimo/upload/upload-to-documenten-api-with-metadata.md).
  When configuring the component in the form builder, various metadata inputs can be given a default value, or be disabled.
  If the component is included in a form for a user task, the user can input metadata for each file upload. These files
  are then registered in the Documenten API on form submission.

## Bugfixes

The following bugs were fixed:

* **Removed the retry in the HttpInterceptor**

  Before the interceptor would always retry an API call if it failed previously.
  This functionality has been removed since it could break applications when timeout (504) errors where being thrown.

* **Assign user in task subscription not destroyed**

  Everytime when the API for getting the list of Valtimo users in a task was loading, it would keep loading even if the task was already completed.
  The subscription is now properly killed and if the task is already completed the API won't be loading anymore.
