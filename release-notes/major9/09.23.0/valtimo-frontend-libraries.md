# Frontend libraries 5.12.0 (RC)

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Added default assignee column to the case list**

  Added a new default column to the `valtimo-dossier-list` component, which displays the full name of the assignee
  for each case when present. This column is sortable, considering the first name and then the lastname.

  To display the new column, it is required to add data in the `environment.ts` file (see example below).
  #### **`environment.ts`**

  ```typescript
  export const environment: ValtimoConfig = { ...
    {
    propertyName: 'assigneeFullName',
    translationKey: 'assigneeFullName',
    sortable: true,
    }
   }
  ```

* **Added modifier property to customDossierHeaderItems**
  
  In a `customDossierHeaderItem` you can now pass a `modifier` property to modify how the data for the
  header item is rendered. The only allowed modifier at this moment is the `age` modifier which renders
  a date string as an age (see example below).

  ```typescript
  customDossierHeader: {
    dossierName: [
      {
        labelTranslationKey: 'Age',
        propertyPaths: ['personA.dateOfBirth'],
        modifier: 'age'
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* **Added warning message to user management page**

  On the user management page an admin can now see a warning message that notifies them about the fact that user management is handled separately in Keycloak in case Keycloak is used for IAM. The message can be customized by using the translation key `User management not supported`.
  
## Bugfixes

The following bugs were fixed:

* **Semicolon in customDossierHeaderItem**

  The semicolon between label and value in custom dossier header items were rendered when only a `labelTranslationKey`
  was defined. It will now only render a semicolon when both the `labelTranslationKey` and the `propertyPaths` are
  defined.
