# Frontend libraries 5.12.0 (RC)

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Added default assignee column to the case list**

  Added a new default column to the `valtimo-dossier-list` component, which displays the full name of the assignee
  for each case when present. This column is sortable, considering the first name and then the lastname.

  To display the new column, it is required to add data in the `environment.ts` file (see example below).
  #### **`environment.ts`**

  ```typescript
  export const environment: ValtimoConfig = { ...
    {
    propertyName: 'assigneeFullName',
    translationKey: 'assigneeFullName',
    sortable: true,
    }
   }
  ```
