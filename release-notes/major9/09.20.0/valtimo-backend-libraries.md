# Backend libraries 9.20.0

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Additional method for finding documents from within a process**

  The `search` method in the `JsonSchemaDocumentSearchService` does not work when retrieving a document if no
  authorization is found. A new method, `searchWithoutAuthorization` is now available. For classes that implement the 
  `DocumentSearchService`, this method has a default and only needs to be implemented if this use case is necessary.

* **Zaakobjecten can now be edited**

  When creating a form that includes a propertyName with "zaakobject:objecttype:path/to/variable" it will now be
  prefilled when loading the form. When submitting the form the corresponding zaakobject is updated with the new values
  
  The uploading is handled by a new `ExternalDataSubmittedEvent` handler called `ZaakObjectListener`

* **KeyCloak**

  KeyCloak libraries have been updated to 19.0.1. Older KeyCloak server versions are still supported.

## Bugfixes

No bugfixes.

## Breaking changes

* **Added extra parameter to KeycloakService**
  The `KeycloakService` constructor now requires an additional parameter called `keycloakClientName`.

Instructions on how to migrate to this version of Valtimo can be found [here](migration.md).

## Deprecations

No new deprecations.

## Known issues

This version has the following known issues:

* **Multiple existing form associations on process definition**

  When multiple start forms are associated with a single process definition the user is unable to start a new case of
  that specific type.
  
* **Updating process variables from a form.io submission**  
  Only process variables of type `String` and `Array<String>` are currently supported by the pv. form.io prefix. Any other types will be set to a null value.
