# Backend libraries 9.19.0 (RC)

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Filter out plugin configurations without actions of a service type**

  The plugin configuration can now be filtered based on an activityType (i.e. Service Task), that will 
  ensure that any plugin configuration that is returned has an action for that activityType. 

  The REST endpoint `GET /api/plugin/configuration` now supports a new request parameter
  called `activityType` which expects the type of task that was clicked in the process. 
  Example: `GET /api/plugin/configuration?activityType=bpmn:ServiceTask`.

* **New form flow `onBack` property**

  Form flows already supported the `onOpen` and `onComplete` properties. The `onBack` property has been added that is
  triggered when navigating to a previous step. Information on how to use these properties in a form flow can be found
  [here](/using-valtimo/form-flow/create-form-flow-definition.md#expressions).


* **New feature2**

## Bugfixes

The following bugs were fixed:

* **JdbcProcessFormAssociationRepository insert statement runtime exception**

  Running on an externally hosted Mysql 8.0.15 instance caused unknown column type exceptions with `useServerPrepStmts`. For more information [see](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/MySQL-Configuration).
  To prevent determining the sql column type now the type is specified.
