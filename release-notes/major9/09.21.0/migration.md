# Migration

This page describes how to update Valtimo from the previous version to the current.

* **FormFieldDataResolver `get` method is deprecated**

  Scope: backend

  1. **Implement the new `get` method**
     
      Add method `get(DataResolvingContext dataResolvingContext, String... varNames)` to your class and move the logic from the deprecated `get` to this new method. 
      The parameters `String documentDefinitionName` and `UUID documentId` are moved to the `DataResolvingContext` object. 


* **New datepicker component flatpickr**
    
  Scope: frontend

  If this component is included anywhere in an implementation:

  1. **Install flatpickr dependency**
  
      Run `npm install flatpickr` to install the dependency. 
      
      When upgrading to [Valtimo frontend libraries 5.12.0](/release-notes/major9/09.23.0/valtimo-frontend-libraries.md)
      this is no longer necessary as the dependency is included in the libraries.
  
  2. **Add style to angular.json**

      Add `"node_modules/flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.css"` to the styles array in `angular.json` to avoid issues.
