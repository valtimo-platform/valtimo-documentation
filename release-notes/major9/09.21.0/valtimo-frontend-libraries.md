# Frontend libraries 5.10.0

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Sorted processes in progress tab**

  The processes that are displayed in the progress tab are now sorted with active processes first.

* **System processes**
  Processes can now be marked as a system process. System processes are processes that are critical
  to the functioning of Valtimo itself. When a process is marked as a system process it will be shown 
  in the list of processes and when viewing a process. If the process is also marked as read-only it
  will not be editable from the frontend.

  More information about this feature can be found [here](/using-valtimo/process/systemprocesses.md).

* **Added environment property to set the supported filetypes for uploading a file**
  
  A new property `caseFileUploadAcceptedFiles` can be used in the environment file to whitelist the supported filetypes 
  when trying to upload a file in the documents tab.

  The way to use this is to create a comma separated list of mime types or file extensions.
  
  Eg.: `image/*,application/pdf,.psd`

* **New documents tab for Documenten API uploads**

  If `uploadProvider` is set to `UploadProvider.DOCUMENTEN_API` in the environment, a new documents tab is shown. This
  tab only allows one file upload at a time. On selecting a file, a modal opens with a form to input metadata for the
  Documenten API. For more information on how to configure Documenten API uploads, refer to [this page](/using-valtimo/upload/upload-to-documenten-api-with-metadata.md).

* **Link upload process to a case on case management page**

  If `uploadProvider` is set to `UploadProvider.DOCUMENTEN_API` in the environment, the upload process that is used
  for uploading files can be set on the admin page of a case definition.

* **New datepicker component**

  Added a new date picker component to `@valtimo/user-interface`: `v-date-picker`. It is based on [flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/).
  If this component is included anywhere in an implementation, add `"node_modules/flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.css"` to the
  `styles` array in `angular.json` to avoid issues.

* **Added new plugin actions to Documenten API and Zaken API plugin**

  New actions have been added to the Documenten API and Zaken API plugins: **Link uploaded document to zaak** and
  **Save uploaded document** respectively. After these plugin actions have been selected, the user does not have to
  input any configuration data.

  For more information on these new plugin actions refer to [this page](/using-valtimo/plugin/documenten-api/configure-documenten-api-plugin.md)
  for the Documenten API and [this page](/using-valtimo/plugin/zaken-api/configure-zaken-api-plugin.md) for the Zaken API.

* **Set file extensions that open directly in the browser**

  You can now add a new environment property `supportedDocumentFileTypesToViewInBrowser` to declare which files are opened in the browser. All the files that are not included will not open in the browser but instead will be directly downloaded.

* **The style of the button in the v-prompt in @valtimo/user-interface can now be set**

  The `v-prompt in @valtimo/user-interface` can now include a `ButtonType` value for both the cancel and confirm button.

## Bugfixes

The following bugs were fixed:

* **Documents from the document can not be viewed in a new tab in Firefox**

  Everytime you would open a file on Firefox you would be redirected to the `Dashboard page` and you would not be able to see or download the file.
  A global fix is applied to open a file correctly and if it fails for some reason it will be downloaded automatically.

* **BodyText of the v-prompt in @valtimo/user-interface can now be set properly**

  The `v-prompt in @valtimo/user-interface` was always showing the bodyText of the keycloak refresh token prompt.

* **Button styling is not set in the v-button in @valtimo/user-interface**

  The `v-button in @valtimo/user-interface` was not able to handle async values since it was not listening to any changes.

## Breaking changes

No breaking changes.

## Deprecations

No new deprecations.

## Known issues

This version has the following known issues:

* **Experimental DMN editing**
  * Editing only works for DRM file with a single DRM table. If multiple tables exist, the overview list of decision
    tables shows multiple entries.
  * It is not possible to create a new DMN table from scratch from the ui.
  * It is not possible to edit the key of a DMN table.

* **Missing flatpickr dependency**
  
  In front-end libraries verison 5.10.0, a new datepicker component has been added to `@valtimo/user-interface`. This
  component has a dependency on `flatpickr`, however, this was not included in the dependencies of
  `@valtimo/user-interface`. This dependency will be included in a future version.

  To fix this for now, add the latest
  version of `flatpickr` to the dependencies of the implementation by running `npm install flatpickr`.
