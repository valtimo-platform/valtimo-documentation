# Backend libraries 9.21.0

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Improved CamundaProcessJsonSchemaDocumentInstance**

  The `isActive` property of the `CamundaProcessJsonSchemaDocumentInstance` indicates whether the process is still running.

* **System processes**

  Processes can now be marked as a system process. System processes are processes that are critical 
  to the functioning of Valtimo itself. More information about this feature can be found 
  [here](/using-valtimo/process/systemprocesses.md).


## Bugfixes

* Process variables of type `Boolean` and `Number` submitted via form-io using the pv. prefix 
were incorrectly parsed as text values thereby replacing the initially submitted value with `null`.

## Breaking changes

No breaking changes

## Deprecations

The following was deprecated:

* **FormFieldDataResolver `get` method**

  The method `get(String documentDefinitionName, UUID documentId, String... varNames)` was deprecated and \
  is replaced with `get(DataResolvingContext dataResolvingContext, String... varNames)`.

Instructions on how to migrate to this version of Valtimo can be found [here](migration.md).

## Known issues

This version has the following known issues:

* **Multiple existing form associations on process definition**

  When multiple start forms are associated with a single process definition the user is unable to start a new case of
  that specific type.
* **Updating process variables from a form.io submission**  
  Only process variables of type `String`, `Number`, `Boolean` and `Array<String>` are currently supported by 
  the pv. form.io prefix. Any other types will be set to a `null` value.
