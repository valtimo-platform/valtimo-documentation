# Migration

This page describes how to update Valtimo from the previous version to the current.

* **Case settings**

  Scope: Back-end

  In order to support case settings, a new module was introduced. This is required for case settings to work, which
  front-end uses. Information on how to include this module can be found [here](/getting-started/modules/core/case.md).

* **Added extra parameter to DocumentSearchService**

  Scope: backend

  Custom implementations of the `DocumentSearchService` now require `userManagementService` as a parameter in the super
  constructor. The userManagementService is a Spring bean and can be obtained in a similar fashion as all other
  constructor parameters. The constructor should look like this:

  ```java
  public MyCustomDocumentSearchService(
      EntityManager entityManager,
      QueryDialectHelper queryDialectHelper,
      SearchFieldService searchFieldService,
      UserManagementService userManagementService
  ) {
      super(entityManager, queryDialectHelper, searchFieldService, userManagementService);
      ...
  }
  ```
