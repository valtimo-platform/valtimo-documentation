# Migration

This page describes how to update Valtimo from the previous version to the current.

* **Case settings**

  Scope: Back-end

  In order to support case settings, a new module was introduced. This is required for case settings to work, which
  front-end uses. Information on how to include this module can be found [here](/getting-started/modules/core/case.md).
