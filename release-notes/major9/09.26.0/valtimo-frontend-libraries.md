# Frontend libraries 5.15.0 (RC)

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Override default case list tabs**

  A new (optional) environment property, `visibleDossierListTabs` is introduced to change the visibility of the default tabs in the `valtimo-dossier-list` component.

  The new property is an array that includes the tabs that need to be visible on the page. The collection can consist of the following values: `DossierListTab.MINE`, `DossierListTab.OPEN`, and `DossierListTab.ALL`.

  Only cases assigned to the current user are displayed when the option 'my cases' are selected. When selecting the 'unassigned cases'  tab, only the cases with no assignee set are shown.

  With this new property, you can either hide specific tabs that are visible by default or change their default order.
