# Backend libraries 9.24.0 (RC)

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Feature toggle: handle disabled for input fields differently**

  Disabled form fields are prefilled and saved by default. This behaviour deviates from the web-standard where disabled elements are not included in the submit body.
  
  It is now possible to toggle this behaviour so that disabled fields will not be prefilled nor saved.

  For more information on using this feature toggle see [this page](/using-valtimo/forms/forms.md).
