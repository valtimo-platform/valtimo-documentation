# Backend libraries 9.17.0

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Improved DocumentVariableDelegateImpl**

  The `findValueByJsonPointer` method of the `DocumentVariableDelegateImpl` class
  now returns a collection of elements instead of throwing an exception
  when the node is an ArrayNode.


* **Postgres support**

  Almost all modules within Valtimo now have support for Postgres databases. The exceptions are:
  - `form-flow-valtimo`
  
  Information on how to use Postgres can be found [here](/getting-started/database-support.md).


* **Secret keys in plugins are encypted before storing**

  Properties in plugins can now be marked as secret. When configuring the plugin the secrets will be encrypted before 
  being stored.

  This functionality requires an application property `valtimo.plugin.encryption-secret` the value of this property will
  determine the encryption key. The encryption-secret has to be at least 16 characters long
  
  More information on plugin secrets can be found [here](/extending-valtimo/plugin/custom-plugin-definition.md#plugin-properties).

* **Support for Keycloak resource roles**

  In addition to the realm roles, Valtimo can now also include resource roles for a specified client. Add the client
  name to the configuration under the key `valtimo.keycloak.client` and its roles will be included.

## Bugfixes

The following bugs were fixed:

* **Changeset errors on Liquibase 4.8.0 and higher**

  `foreignKeyTableName` is required for `foreignKeyConstraintExists` on Liquibase 4.8.0 and higher. Existing changesets did not implement this property.

## Breaking changes

No known breaking changes.

## Deprecations

No new deprecations.

## Known issues

This version has the following known issues:

* **Multiple form associations on process definition**

  When multiple start forms are associated with a single process definition, the user is unable to start a new case of
  that specific type.

* **Updating process variables from a form.io submission**  
  Only process variables of type `String` and `Array<String>` are currently supported by the pv. form.io prefix. Any other types will be set to a null value.

* **New required application property**

  There is a new mandatory application property `valtimo.plugin.encryption-secret`. The encryption-secret has to be at least
  16 characters long.
