# Migration

This page describes how to update Valtimo from the previous to this version.

* **FormFieldDataResolver supports method**
    
    A new supports method `supports(String externalFormFieldType)` replaces the
    already existing `supports(ExternalFormFieldType externalFormFieldType)` method
    for the `FormFieldDataResolver` interface.

  1. **Replace uses of old method with new method**

     If the old method was used, the new method can be used by converting the
     existing argument to a string.

  2. **Implement new supports method**

     For classes implementing the `FormFieldDataResolver` interface, the new method
     should be implemented.

* **Changed ExternalDataSubmittedEvent data field type**

     The `data` field for the `ExternalDataSubmittedEvent` has changed from `Map<ExternalFormFieldType, Map<String, Object>>` to
     `Map<String, Map<String, Object>>`.

  1. **Replace use of the old Map to the new type**

     if an `ExternalDataSubmittedEvent` is created, the Map should now be created with the `.toString()` method on the
     `ExternalFormFieldType`.
