# Backend libraries

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Camunda webapps**

  The Camunda webapps, including the cockpit, were made available. For existing Valtimo projects additional 
  infrastructure configuration might be required to grant access to the `/camunda/app` path. See 
  [this page](/valtimo-implementation/modules/camunda-webapps.md) for more information.

* **Plugins**

  Plugins are extensions on the Valtimo platform. These are often connections to external
  services, such as transactional email and  generating documents. Some plugins are provided
  by the platform, but developers can create their own plugins as well. Plugins can be
  configured without writing code, and can be used during BPMN processes. See 
  [this page](/introduction/modules/plugin-introduction.md) for more information.

* **Smart documents plugin**
