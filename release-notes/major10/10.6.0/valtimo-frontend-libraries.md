# Frontend libraries 10.6.0

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Loading indicator Documenten API documents tab**

  The documents tab shown on a case detail page when Documenten API has been configured as the upload provider, now
  shows loading animations when loading the list of files linked to the case, and when downloading files.

* **Added featureToggle to make the application title a suffix**

  By default, the application title is shown in the browser tab as a prefix e.g. 'Valtimo - Processes'.
  We have added the featureToggle `applicationTitleAsSuffix` to be able to change this to 'Processes - Valtimo' 
  from the environment files.
  
* **Configuration component for the 'Link Document to Besluit' plugin action**

  The 'Link Document to Besluit' plugin action under the Besluiten API plugin now includes a front-end configuration
  component.

* **Configuration components for Catalogi API plugin actions**

  The following Catalogi API plugin actions now have configuration components:
  - Retrieve Statustype
  - Retrieve Resultaattype
  - Retrieve Besluittype

* **Triggering fresh searches every time**

  The search functionality on the case list page has been improved to trigger a search every time, even if the search term has not changed. 
  This change enables users to search seamlessly, even when working with asynchronous data.

* **Case list refactor**

  Over time, much functionality had been added to the case list page. All these elements did not always work
  together properly, nor were they optimal from a user experience perspective. The case list component has been
  refactored with the following points in mind:
  * State (pagination, sorting) is no longer saved in the local storage. When navigating to the case list page
    of a document definition, the default state as configured in the environment file or in the API is shown.
  * The current assignee filter is now saved in query parameters in the URL.
  * When navigating to a case list page using a URL with query parameters, the list state (pagination, sorting, search,
    assignee filter) is restored from these parameters. This includes going back to the case list page from a case
    detail page using the back button.


* **Task forms are now retrieve using a new API**

  When opening a user task, the form is now loaded using the new API endpoint:

  ```GET /api/v2/process-link/task/{id}```

* **Upgraded deprecated `carbon-components` package in `@valtimo/components` to `@carbon/styles`**

  One of the Carbon Design System packages was deprecated and has been upgraded to the new package

* **New process links screen**

  The process links screen (/process-links) has been updated to use Carbon design. The linking of forms, FormFlow and
  plugin actions to a process step is now unified in a single modal. From this same modal, process links can also be
  edited and unlinked.

* **User settings / navigation bar always collapsible**
  
  The right sidebar now saves the currently selected language in the database under user settings, which means that the
  language a user has selected will be the default when they log in with another device. In addition, a setting to always
  make the navigation bar collapsible, regardless of screen size, has been added. This setting is also stored in the
  database and thus the same on any device the user uses.

* **Maximum of 20 SmartDocument placeholders**

  The maximum number of 20 SmartDocument placeholders has been removed. It is now possible to enter many more
  placeholders. The maximum has been removed for all multi-input components within Valtimo. Which means that the maximum
  has also been removed for other features, such as the Verzoeken plugin mapping.

## Bugfixes

The following bugs were fixed:

* **Context detail not loading properly**

  Fixed an issue where the buttons next to the processes weren't initialized properly.

* **Modal dispersal on error when creating an object in Object management**

  The modal will now stay open and an error will be shown when used enters invalid information when creating an object.

* **Case list bug fixes**

  In conjunction with the case list refactor mentioned under new features, the following issues were fixed:
  * Boolean values (displayed as Yes/No) are now translated.
  * When navigating to a case list page without query parameters, the default sort as specified in an environment file
    or in the API is now used on first load.
  * Date formats specified in list columns of type date are used to correctly display the date value in the desired
    format.
  
* **Form dropdown list on object management page not loading all forms**
  When there were more than 50 forms available not all of them would be listed in the view and edit form dropdowns on
  the edit page of the object management definition. This has now been resolved.
