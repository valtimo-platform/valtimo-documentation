  On the admin page of a case type, a tab 'List' is now available. On this tab, case list columns for this case type can
  be added, modified, and re-ordered.

## Bugfixes

The following bugs were fixed:

* **caseassignee dropdown breaks when user has no lastname in keycloak**

  When a user has been configured in keycloak without a lastname, the dropdown of the caseassignee breaks. A check as been added to handle users without a lastname.

* **Custom case header not working if canHaveAssignee is disabled**

  The custom header was only working if the setting `canHaveAssignee` was enabled in the case settings. A fix has been applied to make the custom case header also work without this setting enabled.

* **Connector configuration shows wrong configuration**

  The popup to edit a connector configuration properties, sometimes showed the properties of another connector. This has
  been fixed.

* **Wrong url on 'back' button on Form creation page**

  On the Form creation page (/form-management/create), the back button directed the user to an non-existing URL. This caused the user to be redirected to the dashboard. The URL has been changed to the correct one.
