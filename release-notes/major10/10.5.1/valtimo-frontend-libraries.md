The following bugs were fixed:

*   **Maximum of 20 SmartDocument placeholders**

    The maximum number of 20 SmartDocument placeholders has been removed. It is now possible to enter many more placeholders. The maximum has been removed for all multi-input components within Valtimo. Which means that the maximum has also been removed for other features, such as the Verzoeken plugin mapping.
