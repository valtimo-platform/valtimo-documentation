* **Correctly display special characters in document generated by SmartDocuments**

  The documents generated by SmartDocuments did not display special characters correctly. This has been fixed.

* **Fixed error when generating documents**

  In a rare case, an error was thrown after generating a document with SmartDocuments. This has been fixed.

* **Correctly closing an InputStream**

  After doing a REST call to SmartDocuments, an InputStream would be opened but never closed. This has been fixed.

  Sometimes during the startup phase, an 'Out of memory' error would occur. This was caused by a large number of threads
  that would all start scanning the classpath at the same time. This has been fixed.
