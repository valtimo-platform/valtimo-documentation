The following features were added:

* **Improved error messages in popup**

  The popup showing the error messages has been improved in several ways:
  - It now more often shows the details of the error.
  - It now more often shows a reference ID of the error.
  - When the popup is clicked, it won't disappear. Making it easier to copy the error from the popup.
