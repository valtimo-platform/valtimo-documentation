# Backend libraries 10.3.0

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Added Portaaltaak plugin**

  This plugin makes it possible for Valtimo to communicate and interact
  with a Portal task specification compliant ZGW component.

* **Valtimo dependencies**

  Two new modules have been introduced to help with managing dependencies. These are [Valtimo dependencies](/getting-started/modules/core/valtimo-dependencies.md) and
  [Valtimo GZAC dependencies](/getting-started/modules/zgw/valtimo-gzac-dependencies.md). Including these dependencies
  in a project will automatically include the core modules for that edition of Valtimo, which also improves the
  experience when upgrading Valtimo to a new version.
