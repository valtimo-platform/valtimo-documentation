# Frontend libraries 10.0.0

## New Features

The following features were added:

* **Angular upgrade to version 14**

  Angular has been upgraded from version 13 to version 14. [This version supports many new features](https://blog.angular.io/angular-v14-is-now-available-391a6db736af).
  To be able to use the libraries with this new version, please refer to [the migration page for this release](migration.md).

* **Carbon design system**

  The interface shell (top bar, sidebars, page layout) has been refactored to make use of the [Carbon design system](https://carbondesignsystem.com/).
  Future features will be built using Carbon components, and existing components will be gradually replaced by Carbon
  components. Implementations are also recommended to make use of Carbon components.
  
  Refer to [this page](migration.md) for instructions on how to adjust your implementation to work with Carbon.
