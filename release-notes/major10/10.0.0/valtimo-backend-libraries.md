* **Support for MySQL 8**

  Official support for MySQL 8 has been added. If your database server is running on MySQL 5.7, it is recommended to
  upgrade to MySQL 8. See [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading.html) for instructions on how to
  upgrade a MySQL installation.

## Bugfixes

No bugfixes.

## Breaking changes

The following breaking changes were introduced:

* **Java 17**

  Valtimo is now compiled on Java 17 and needs to run in a Java 17 environment.

* **View configurator module**

  The view configurator module that was used by the old AngularJS front-end has been removed.

* **Process data object relation**

  Process data object relations were a way to link a stored object to a running process. When document definitions were
  introduced, this functionality was made obsolete. Process data object relations have now been removed.

* **REST API versioning**

  Every REST endpoint exposed by Valtimo now contains a version, e.g. `/api/document` becomes `/api/v1/document`.
  This makes it easier to support multiple versions in the future in case of breaking changes in the REST API, without
  waiting for a new major version of Valtimo.

* **Removed deprecated code**

  A number of deprecated methods and classes have been removed, and as a result some implementations need to make minor
  changes. 

* **Removed JWT configuration properties**

  The properties `valtimo.jwt.base64encoding` and  `valtimo.jwt.tokenValidityInSecondsForRememberMe` have been removed as they were used in a closed-source module that is no longer supported.

Instructions on how to migrate to this version of Valtimo can be found [here](migration.md).
