# Release notes

This section contains the release notes for the different versions of Valtimo. These release notes contain information 
on what is new, bugs that have been fixed, breaking changes, code that has been deprecated, and known issues for that 
release version. Additionally, when a new version does not work out of the box, migration notes are present.

This section is intended for everyone who wants to know what changed in a version of Valtimo. Migration notes are 
intended for more technical users, e.g. a system administrator who wants to keep their Valtimo installation up to date.
