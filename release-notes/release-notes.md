# Release notes

This section contains the release notes for the different versions of Valtimo. These can be used to find out what is
new in a specific version, as well as the bugs that have been fixed. When needed migration notes are available when an
update does not work out of the box. This section is intended for system administrators that want to keep their Valtimo
installation up to date.
