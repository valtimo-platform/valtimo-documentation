## New Features

* **Add Case Objects to Case**

A new plugin action has been added to the Zaken API Plugin, allowing users to create a case object directly within a 
process. This feature can be used whenever someone needs to link an existing object to a case.

## Bugfixes

* The `showTasks` property is now imported correctly when importing a case tab.
* Improved performance of retrieving permissions for a user when having to do a permission check.
