# 12.12.0

## New features

#### Task due date and assignee

When opening a task, the header now shows the task due date. When the logged in user has `modify`  permissions on the task (resource `com.ritense.valtimo.camunda.domain.CamundaTask` ), they are also able to update the task due date directly in the header.

Additionally, assigning a user to the task has been changed. A confirmation modal is now shown, indicating that the task has actually been assigned after submission.

## Bugfixes

* With an existing process variable of type Map, writing data to that variable using the value resolver would overwrite the whole map instead of adding the property to the map.

#### Get objects by index

The Objecten API plugin and the `ObjectManagementFacade` now support retrieving an object based on the UUID and the version index:

* ObjectenApiPlugin.getObjectRecord(objectUrl: URI, index: Int)
* ObjectManagementFacade.findObjectByUuidAndIndex(accessObject: ObjectManagementAccessObject, uuid: UUID, index: Int)
