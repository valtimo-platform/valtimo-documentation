# 12.13.0 (backend only)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Breaking change: version 12.13.0 introduces the implementation of additional access control checks. Upgrading to this version without configuring extra permissions might cause errors and loss of functionality.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This version resolves the vulnerability (CVE 8,6) explained [here](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
At the moment of writing, only the 12.13.0 backend has been released. This page will be updated when the frontend release has been published as well.

## New features - GZAC edition

### Access control for Objects

Access Control checks have been implemented for interaction with the Objecten API. Because the Objects and Objecttypes are not part of the GZAC database, the permissions are limited to include only an action. The following actions are available:

* `view`
* `view_list`
* `create`
* `modify`
* `delete`



An example of Object permissions look as follows:

```
"permissions": [
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "create"
        },
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "modify"
        },
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "view"
        },
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "view_list"
        },
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "delete"
        }
    ]
```

To reduce the impact of this breaking change, an application property has been added to disable the access control checks for Objects. The following properties can be set to `false` :

* `valtimo.authorization.objectenapi.enabled`  (application property), or
* `VALTIMO_AUTHORIZATION_OBJECTENAPI_ENABLED` (environment variable)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Disabling the access control checks for Objects can be a severe security risk and is highly discouraged.

### Stop All Processes for a Case

It is now possible to terminate all running processes that are associated with a specific case.
This can be achieved by configuring a BPMN ServiceTask expression:

```bpmn
${processService.deleteAllProcessInstancesForThisDocument(execution, "Test deletion process")}
```

#### Details

- The expression stops all active process instances related to the current case/document.
- A _reason_ can be provided as a parameter (in the example above: "Test deletion process").
- Once invoked, all processes for the case are stopped immediately.

## Bugfixes

### CallActivity Execution with StartEvent

Previously, when a **BPMN process** was modeled such that a **CallActivity** was triggered **synchronously with the
StartEvent**, the process would fail during execution and result in an error.

This issue has now been resolved:

- CallActivities can safely be modeled to start directly with the StartEvent.
- Processes that use this pattern will now execute correctly without requiring workarounds.
