# 12.13.0 (backend only)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Breaking change: version 12.13.0 introduces the implementation of additional access control checks. Upgrading to this version without configuring extra permissions might cause errors and loss of functionality.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This version resolves the vulnerability (CVE 8,6) explained [here](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p).

## New features - GZAC edition

#### Access control for Objects

Access Control checks have been implemented for interaction with the Objecten API. Because the Objects and Objecttypes are not part of the GZAC database, the permissions are limited to include only an action. The following actions are available:

* `view`
* `view_list`
* `create`
* `modify`
* `delete`



An example of Object permissions look as follows:

```
"permissions": [
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "create"
        },
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "modify"
        },
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "view"
        },
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "view_list"
        },
        {
            "resourceType": "com.ritense.objectenapi.security.Object",
            "action": "delete"
        }
    ]
```

To reduce the impact of this breaking change, an application property has been added to disable the access control checks for Objects. The following properties can be set to `false` :

* `valtimo.authorization.objectenapi.enabled`  (application property), or
* `VALTIMO_AUTHORIZATION_OBJECTENAPI_ENABLED` (environment variable)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Disabling the access control checks for Objects can be a severe security risk and is highly discouraged.
