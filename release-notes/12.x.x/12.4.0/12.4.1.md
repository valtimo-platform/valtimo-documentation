# 12.4.1

## Bugfixes

* List columns of type 'Enum' were not shown correctly in the case list. Instead, either no value or the original value was shown
* In some scenario's, the Documenten API upload component caused the form to not be validated correctly. This led to forms being not submittable while all required fields had been filled in.
* A Form.io selectbox component inside an editgrid component was not shown correctly.
* Disabled Form.io textfields looked identical to regular textfields, causing users to be confused which fields should be filled in. To fix this issue, a Form.io theme has been implemented and customized, to look like the Carbon design.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Form.io related bugs have been fixed by implementing a Form.io template. This template requires adding an additional CSS file to the implementation. This can be done by adding the following entry to the "styles" array in the angular.json file:

`"node_modules/@valtimo/components/assets/css/formio-carbon.scss"`
