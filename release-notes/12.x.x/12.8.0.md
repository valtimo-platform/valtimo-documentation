# 12.8.0

## New features

#### Importing process link configuration

Process link configurations can now be reused. The process link configuration form includes a new option to **import** the configuration from another process link from the same plugin. For example, if two tasks both generate a PDF document, the import function allows you to copy the template-data mapping from one process link to the other, reducing duplicate work and minimizing manual errors.

#### Value path selector

To simplify case configuration, the 'value path selector' has been added to the case widget configuration. This feature allows users to select case properties directly, eliminating the need to manually type a JsonPath and reducing the risk of typos and misconfigurations.

#### Hiding empty case widget fields

Case widgets now support hiding fields that do not have a value. This ensures that fields that are either not relevant for a specific case or have not yet been filled in are not displayed to the case handler, preventing unnecessary clutter and saving space.

#### Access control for Documenten API documents

Access control can now be configured for Documenten API documents. Permissions can be configured to view, create, modify and delete documents.&#x20;

Unlike other access control resources, permissions for Documenten API documents do not support conditions. More information on the permissions can be found [here](../../features/access-control/).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: to enable access control for the Documenten API document, the following configuration should be added:

* Feature toggle `enablePbacDocumentenApiDocuments` should be set to `true` in the Valtimo frontend configuration.
* Application property `valtimo.authorization.zgwDocuments.enabled` should be set to `true` in the Valtimo backend configuration, or
* Environment variable `VALTIMO_AUTHORIZATION_ZGW_DOCUMENTS_ENABLED`should be set to true in the Valtimo backend
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Bugfixes

* Assigning a user to a case caused an error in the following scenario:
  * The property 'automatically assign tasks to case handler' has been enabled
  * The assigned case handler does not have 'assignable' permissions for one of the user tasks
* Leading zeros in plugin action property values are now correctly retained. Values like '0123' are no longer stripped of their leading zeros.
* Existing internal case statuses are now correctly updated during autodeployment.
* The breadcrumbs endpoint is no longer called when the breadcrumb feature toggle is disabled.
* Tags on the case list now display the correct content when multiple tags columns have been configured.&#x20;
* The width of the supporting process dropdown now adjusts dynamically based on the process name length.
* The path selector within plugin configurations now maintains a consistent width after selecting a path.
* Form.io datagrids, wizard header, tabs and panel headers now better align with the Carbon design system.

* After uploading a file on the documents tab, the uploaded file was not cleared. This caused duplication of documents when uploading multiple files in succession.
* Metadata fields in the Documenten API are now exported with their original casing. Previously, fields like `AANVULLENDE_DATUM` were exported in uppercase, causing inconsistencies during auto-deployment.
* The 'Zaakdetail-synchronisatie' configuration now persists after updating the document definition.
