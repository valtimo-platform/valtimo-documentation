<summary>GZAC edition</summary>

*   The Zaken API communicates Zaak lifecycle events as Spring Application Events. It concerns the following Zaak lifecycle events:

    * DocumentLinkedToZaak
    * ZaakRolCreated
    * ZaakRolUpdated
    * ZaakCreated
    * ZaakPatched
    * ZaakStatusCreated
    * ZaakResultaatCreated
    * ZaakOpschortingUpdated
    * ZaakeigenschapCreated
    * ZaakeigenschapUpdated
    * ZaakeigenschapDeleted
    * ZaakObjectCreated

    These events are already available to external systems using the outbox module.
* Value path selector: When passing an empty array of prefixes to the _value-path-selector_ component, all custom value-resolver prefixes are available in the dropdown.
