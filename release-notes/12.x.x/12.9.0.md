# 12.9.0

## New features

The layout of logging details has been improved. Important lines in the stacktrace are now highlighted for better readability and faster debugging.

## Bugfixes

* Uploaded documents are now correctly uploaded when using a process variable as form field key.
* When a reference to an already uploaded document was pre-filled in the form of a succeeding user task, the document was uploaded again.
* Log level tags are now displayed in the correct color, instead of the default blue.
* Long status names are now properly displayed on the case detail page and in the case list.
