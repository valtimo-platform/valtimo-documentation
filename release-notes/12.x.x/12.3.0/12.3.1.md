# 12.3.1

## Bugfixes

* A Form.io selectbox component inside an editgrid component was not shown correctly.
* Disabled Form.io textfields looked identical to regular textfields, causing users to be confused which fields should be filled in. To fix this issue, a Form.io theme has been implemented and customized, to look like the Carbon design.
