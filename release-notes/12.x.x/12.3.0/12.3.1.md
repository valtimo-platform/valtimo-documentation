# 12.3.1

## Bugfixes

* A Form.io selectbox component inside an editgrid component was not shown correctly.
* Disabled Form.io textfields looked identical to regular textfields, causing users to be confused which fields should be filled in. To fix this issue, a Form.io theme has been implemented and customized, to look like the Carbon design.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Form.io related bugs have been fixed by implementing a Form.io template. This template requires adding an additional CSS file to the implementation. This can be done by adding the following entry to the "styles" array in the angular.json file:

`"node_modules/@valtimo/components/assets/css/formio-carbon.scss"`
{% endhint %}
