# 12.16.0

## Security improvements

* A security advisory has been published [here](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-w48j-pp7j-fj55).
Users with administrator privileges had access to unnecessary resources through the scripting engine available in 
processes. In order to restrict this, a whitelist has been added to Valtimo, which by default only allows access to a
small number of methods and classes in the scripting engine. Further details can be found in the security advisory.
