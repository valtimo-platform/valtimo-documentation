# Migration

This page describes how to update Valtimo from the previous version to the current.

* **Change in Recipient.Type values**

  Scope: back-end

  To meet coding standards, the Enum values of ```com.ritense.valtimo.contract.mail.model.value.Recipient.Type``` have been changed to all uppercase.
  References to these Enum values should be changed in implementations:
    - Change uses of Type.To to Type.TO
    - Change uses of Type.Cc to Type.CC
    - Change uses of Type.Bcc to Type.BCC

* **Rename application property valtimo.jwt.secret**

  Scope: back-end

    1. **Find valtimo.jwt.secret**

       Find all occurrences of `valtimo.jwt.secret` and rename them all to `valtimo.oauth.public-key`. This property is
       usually found in the `application.yml`.

    2. **Find `VALTIMO_JWT_SECRET`**

       Find all occurrences of `VALTIMO_JWT_SECRET` and rename them to `VALTIMO_OAUTH_PUBLIC_KEY`. This environment
       variable can potentially be found in many different places such as:
        - `.env.properties` file inside the repository
        - AWS Parameter store
        - Kubernetes `.yaml` file

* **Rename application property valtimo.jwt.tokenValidityInSeconds**

  Scope: back-end

    1. **Find valtimo.jwt.tokenValidityInSeconds**

       Find all occurrences of `valtimo.jwt.tokenValidityInSeconds` and rename them all
       to `valtimo.oauth.tokenValidityInSeconds`. This property is usually found in the `application.yml`.

    2. **Find `VALTIMO_JWT_TOKEN_VALIDITY_IN_SECONDS`**

       Find all occurrences of `VALTIMO_JWT_TOKEN_VALIDITY_IN_SECONDS` and rename them
       to `VALTIMO_OAUTH_TOKEN_VALIDITY_IN_SECONDS`. This environment variable can potentially be found in many
       different places such as:
        - `.env.properties` file inside the repository
        - AWS Parameter store
        - Kubernetes `.yaml` file

* **Whitelist all services used in Camunda processes**

  Scope: back-end

    1. **Find all services used in processes and decision tables**

       Open all BPMN and DMN files and list all the services and other java/kotlin classes that are used.

    2. **Find all services in code**

       All the listed services must then be found inside the java/kotlin code.

    3. **Whitelist the service**

       Whitelisting a service should be done in one of two different ways:
        1. Either, add `@ProcessBean` above the class.
           For example:
            ```kotlin
            @ProcessBean
            @Service
            class MyCustomClass {
                ...
            ```
        2. Or add `@ProcessBean` above the bean definition.
           For example:
            ```kotlin
            @ProcessBean
            @Bean
            @ConditionalOnMissingBean(MyCustomService::class)
            fun myCustomService(...): MyCustomService {
                return MyCustomService(...)
            }
            ```

* **Remove the use of authority and contexts entities**

  Scope: back-end

    1. **Find and delete the use of authority classes as they are no longer supported**

        - AuthorityResource.java
        - AuthorityService.java
        - AuthorityRepository.java
        - AuthorityCreatedEvent.java
        - AuthorityDeletedEvent.java
        - AuthorityEvent.java
        - AuthorityNameChangedEvent.java
        - Authority.java
        - AuthorityRequest.java
        - Money.java

    2. **Find and delete the use of context classes as they are no longer supported**

        - ContextResource.java
        - ContextService.java
        - ContextRepository.java
        - UserContextRepository.java
        - UserContextDTO.java
        - Context.java
        - ContextProcess.java
        - MenuItem.java
        - UserContext.java

* **Angular and dependency upgrades**

  Scope: front-end

  1. **Upgrading Angular**

      - The Valtimo front-end libraries have been upgraded from Angular 14 to Angular 16 in major 11. In order to use
        them, your implementation also needs to upgrade to Angular 16.
      - Follow [this guide](https://update.angular.io/?v=14.0-15.0) to upgrade from Angular 14 to Angular 15. You will
        probably need to use `ng update` commands with the `--force` option at the end.
      - After the migration is complete, commit your changes.
      - Follow [this guide](https://update.angular.io/?v=15.0-16.0) to upgrade from Angular 15 to Angular 16. You will
       probably need to use `ng update` commands with the `--force` option at the end.
      - After the migration is complete, commit your changes.
      - Verify whether all Angular related dependencies in the `package.json` in the root of your project are at
        version 16. If some have been skipped, check https://www.npmjs.com/ for their latest version and upgrade them
        manually.

  2.  **Removing dependencies**

      - Some dependencies have been removed from the Valtimo front-end libraries. It is advised to remove them from your
        implementation as well.
      - `@angular/flex-layout` has been deprecated. Remove it from your implementation. To replace its directives, we
        advise to write regular CSS classes with flexbox styling.
      - If your implementation does not use any `@angular/material` related dependencies, and they are included in your
        `package.json` dependencies, we advise to remove them.

  3. **Locking dependencies**

      - In Valtimo front-end libraries, all dependencies not related to Angular have been locked to specific versions,
        in order to avoid issues which are frequently encountered with automatic minor or patch dependency upgrades.
      - We advise you to do the same; lock all dependencies except for the ones related to Angular. You can achieve this
        by removing tilde `~` and caret `^` symbols from your implementation's `package.json`.
      - Next, we advise you to lock your dependencies to the same versions used in the Valtimo front-end libraries.
        A non-exhaustive list of dependencies and their versions is included below. If you cannot find your dependency
        in the list below, refer to the major 11 front-end libraries `package.json` [here](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/blob/ac6d123c95fb761079e9d471f6b5aa6943e2bf1e/package.json).

     #### **`package.json`**
     ````json
     {
       ...

         "typescript": "5.1.6"
       }
     }
     ````

  3. **Changing typescript config**

      - In `tsconfig.json` in the root of your implementation, change `module` to `es2020` and also change `es****` in
        the `lib` array to `es2020`.

* **Change in Carbon Design System version**

  Scope: front-end

  1.  **Install new Carbon Dependencies**

      - Delete node_modules.
      - Run 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps'.

  2.  **Update all carbon selectors from 'ibm' to 'cds'**

      #### **`Tags`**:

          Deprecated:
          <ibm-placeholder></ibm-placeholder>

          Active:
          <cds-placeholder></cds-placeholder>

      #### **`Directives`**:

          Deprecated:
          <button ibmButton="primary"></button>

          Active:
          <button cdsButton="primary"></button>

      #### **`Classes`**:

          Deprecated:
          <svg class="ibm--btn__icon"></svg>

          Active:
          <svg class="cds--btn__icon"></svg>

  3.  **Remove all usages of @carbon/icons-angular**

      #### **`Icon`**:
          Deprecated:
          <svg class="ibm--btn__icon" ibmIconArrowDown size="16"></svg>

          Active:
          <svg class="cds--btn__icon" cdsIcon="arrow--down" size="16"></svg>

  4.  **Registering @carbon/icons**

    - In order to use @carbon/icons, the IconModule needs to be imported.

      #### **`sample.module.ts`**
      ````typescript
      ...
      // import IconModule
      import {IconModule} from 'carbon-components-angular';
      ...

      @NgModule({
          ...
          imports: [
            ...
            IconModule
            ...
          ]
          ...
      })
      export class SampleModule {
       ...
      }
      ````
    - Some icons may not be available by default, so they need to be registered in the component where they are needed. This is accomplished via the Carbon IconService
      #### **`sample.component.ts`**
      ````typescript
      ...
      // import IconService
      import {IconService} from 'carbon-components-angular';
      ...
      // import Icons
      import {ArrowDown16, ArrowUp16} from '@carbon/icons';
      ...

      @Component({
          ...
      })
      export class SampleComponent implements OnInit{
       ...
       constructor(private readonly iconService: IconService) {}
       ...
       public ngOnInit(): void {
        this.iconService.registerAll([ArrowDown16, ArrowUp16]);
       }
       ...
      }
      ````
    - All icons available through the Carbon library can be found [here](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-icon--docs)

* **Remove deleted admin menu items**

  Scope: front-end

    1. **Remove @valtimo/context**

        - Remove `@valtimo/context` library from the `package.json`.
        - Remove `ContextModule` module from the `app.module.ts`.

    2. **Remove @valtimo/management**

        - Remove `@valtimo/management` library from the `package.json`.
        - Remove `ManagementContextModule` module from the `app.module.ts`.
        - Remove the `Contexts` link from the `environment.ts`

    3. **Remove @valtimo/user-management**

        - Remove `@valtimo/user-management` library from the `package.json`.
        - Remove `UserManagementModule` module from the `app.module.ts`.
        - Remove the `Users` link from the `environment.ts`

    4. **Remove @valtimo/authority**

        - Remove `@valtimo/authority` library from the `package.json`.
        - Remove `AuthorityModule` module from the `app.module.ts`.
        - Remove the `Entitlements` link from the `environment.ts`

* **Form-links page**

  Scope: front-end

    1. **environment.ts**

       Go to the environment.ts file and change this line:
       
       ```{link: ['/form-links'], title: 'Form links'...```
       
       To this line:
       
       ```{link: ['/process-links'], title: 'Process links'...```

* **Update connector and plugin keys**

  Scope: back-end/front-end

  In order for keys to be encrypted with GCM (as apposed to ECB, see
  [here](valtimo-backend-libraries.md#new-features) for more information), all existing plugin configurations need
  to be updated.

  1. **Save existing connector configurations with their keys**
  2. **Save plugin configurations with their keys**
  3. **See if encryption is used anywhere else in the application**

* **Removal of @valtimo/user-interface library**

  Scope: front-end

  1. **Remove @valtimo/user-interface as a dependency**

      The library `@valtimo/user-interface` has been removed. All of its components, directives and services have been
      been moved to `@valtimo/components`. In order to migrate, remove `@valtimo/user-interface` as a dependency in your
      implementation.
  2. **Change stylesheet in `angular.json`**

      The `angular.json` file in the root of your implementation includes the following value:
     
      `"node_modules/@valtimo/user-interface/assets/design-tokens.css"`

      This should be changed to:

      `"node_modules/@valtimo/components/assets/css/design-tokens.css"`

  3.  **Change imports**

      Most components, services and directives from `@valtimo/user-interface` are now exported from
      `@valtimo/components`. Search your implementations for any imports and change them accordingly.

  4.   **Renamed components**

     The component `v-multi-input` has been renamed to `valtimo-carbon-multi-input`. If it is used anywhere in your
     implementation, change the selector.

     `ModaleModule` exported from `@valtimo/user-interface` is renamed to `VModalModule`.

     `CardModule` exported from `@valtimo/user-interface` is renamed to `VCardModule`.
    
* **Moved Verzoek plugin property `objectManagementId`**

  Scope: back-end

  1. **Locate any .pluginconfig.json file**

      Go to the `/resource` folder of you project and locate any file ending with `.pluginconfig.json`.

  2. **Find the `verzoek` plugin configurations**

     Every `.pluginconfig.json` can contain Verzoek plugin configuration. This plugin can be recognized where the
     property `pluginDefinitionKey` is `verzoek`.

  3.  **Move the `objectManagementId`**

      Every Verzoek plugin configuration has a field called `objectManagementId`. This field should be moved out of
      the `properties` field and into every `verzoekProperties` field.
