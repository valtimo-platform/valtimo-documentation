# Create your own Valtimo implementation

This section contains information on how to create a new Valtimo implementation. It contains information on which 
modules are available and what settings at minimum are required to use them. This section is meant for people who want 
to set up their own Valtimo installation. Some knowledge on java build tools such as [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 
or [gradle](https://gradle.org/) is assumed.

When creating a new Valtimo implementation you can look at [Using Valtimo](/using-valtimo/using-valtimo.md) for more 
information on how to configure and use Valtimo. Explanations on how to extend Valtimo functionality and introduce 
custom functions can be found in the [Extending Valtimo](/extending-valtimo/extending-valtimo.md) section.
