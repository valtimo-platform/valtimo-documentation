# Plugin concepts

* Plugin definition
    * A regular plugin is often referred to as a plugin definition to empathise the difference between the
      implementation of the plugin and the configuration of a plugin. For example: A Twitter plugin is sometimes called
      a Twitter plugin definition.
* Plugin configuration
    * A single plugin can be configured multiple times. For example: a Twitter plugin might have one configuration to
      post tweets for one user and another configuration to post tweets for another user.
* Plugin property
    * A plugin configuration can have multiple properties that can be configured. For example a Twitter plugin
      configuration can have the properties `username` and `password`.
* Plugin action
    * A plugin can have several actions that it can execute. For example: a Twitter plugin might have one action to post
      a tweet and another action to like a tweet.
* Plugin function
    * Synonymous to plugin action
