# Configuring Cross Origin Resource Sharing in Valtimo.
Cross Origin Resource Sharing, aka CORS, is a mechanism to allow access from Javascript resources in the 
browser to fetch resources from different domains then the Javascript is served from. By default, browsers only allow
Javascript to fetch resources from the same domain.

The Valtimo Web module offers functionality to configure CORS in the application.properties file of the Valtimo 
Implementation project. The following example shows the used parameters with specific domain names for the origin and
wildcards for the allowed methods and headers:
```yaml
valtimo:
  web:
    cors:
      corsConfiguration:
        allowedOrigins:
          - http://localhost:8000
          - https://example.valtimowebsites.net
        allowedMethods:
          - "*"
        allowedHeaders:
          - "*"
```
