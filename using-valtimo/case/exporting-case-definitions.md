# Exporting and importing case definitions

A case definition is a collection of configurations and definitions, such as the document definition, process
definitions, forms, form flows and process links. These case definitions can be exported as a ZIP archive, so it can
be imported via the UI, added to the repository or shared with others.

## Export

Exporting can be done by navigating to the case definition detail page and pressing the export button (see image below).
This will result in a ZIP archive containing configurations and definitions that make up the case definition. The
structure is the same as found in any application that makes use of the auto-deployment offered by Valtimo.
