Process actions can be attached to Camunda activities through process links.
Configured actions will be executed when the process reached the desired activity.
This makes it possible to extend the functionality of a process beyond what Camunda offers through BPMN.

Currently, the following types of process-links are supported by Valtimo:
- [Form](create-process-link.md#creating-a-form-process-link)
- [Form-flow](create-process-link.md#creating-a-form-flow-process-link)
- [Plugin](create-process-link.md#creating-a-plugin-process-link)
