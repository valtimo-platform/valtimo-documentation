# Form view model

Form view model is a way to alternatively handle forms in user tasks.

This module is meant to facilitate complex forms mainly seen in large custom projects.
This module allows control of pre-filling, intermediate updates and submissions.

This step-by-step guide will explain the module while showing you how to implement it.

Step 1: Enabling the module in your project (see [Enabling the module](enabling-the-module.md))

Step 2: Define the view-model structure for your form (see [Defining the view-model](defining-the-view-model.md))

Step 3: Define the submission structure for your form (see [Defining the submission structure](defining-the-submission-structure.md))

Step 4: Command handling (see [Command handling](command-handling.md))
