# Search fields

Search fields add the ability to filter cases. Each search field adds the ability to filter on a specific field.
This page describes how the search fields are used within Valtimo.

## Using search fields

Configured search fields can be found on the list page of every case type. So in order to 
find the search fields click on `Cases` in the menu and then select a specific case.

Above the list of cases is a box called `Search`.

By clicking on that box it will expand showing all the available search fields.

## Configure search fields

An administrator is able to add, change, remove, reorder and download a file with all search fields. To see all the 
configured
search fields go the menu `Admin > Cases` and select a specific case. Then click on the tab 
named `Search fields`.

### Available actions

**Edit**: When clicking on an entry in the list of `search fields`, a modal opens with the fields pre-filled with 
the selected item's data. It is possible to edit all the fields, except for the key.
When clicking `submit`, the field data is automatically updated in the list.

**Create**: A button to create a new search field is available at the top of the displayed search field list.
A modal for filling in the data will be presented when clicking on this button. It is necessary to fill in all the 
required data to enable the `submit` button. The key field is specific identification data, so if the key is not unique, 
you will not be able to save the search field.
