# How to start a process for a case

There are two ways to start a process for a case by using the user interface:
- Starting a process with a new case
- Starting a process for an existing case

To be able to start a new case through the user interface, a process has to be connected to it.

## Starting a process with a new case

To start a new process and case a button is available on the cases list page. This can be opened by selecting `Cases`
from the menu and selecting the case type to start.

By using the `Create New Case` button, a popup is opened containing the start form of the process connected to the case
definition.

After submitting the form, a new case is started, and a process is started for the case. The progress of the process can
be viewed on the `Progress` tab.

## Starting a process for an existing case

To start new process for an existing case, a button is available on the case detail page. This can be opened by 
selecting `Cases` from the menu and selecting the case type, then clicking on a case in the list.

After submitting the form, the process is started.

## Starting a process with a new case via code

To start a new process with a new case via code, the `ProcessDocumentService` exposes the `newDocumentAndStartProcess`, 
which accepts a process definition key, the to be created document, the process instance ID 
(which should always be empty as no process instance exists yet) and any variables the process should start with.

## Starting a process for an existing case via code

To start a new process with an existing case via code, the `ProcessDocumentService` exposes the `startProcessForDocument`,
which accepts the document ID, the process definition key and any variables the process should start with.
