# Web

Valtimo uses a client-side architecture where a javascript component runs in the browser of a user (client). To fetch 
data and push changes this component communicates with a server-side component. The Valtimo Web module offers 
functionality to facilitate the communication between the client- and server-side component.

This section contains information on how to configure Cross Origin Resource Sharing (aka CORS) in Valtimo.
