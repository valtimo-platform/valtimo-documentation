configure process links.

Any text fields for configuring the process link itself support several ways of providing values through value
resolvers:

1. A fixed value. This value will be put directly into the template without alterations. For example `John`
2. A value retrieved from the case-data. This value should start with `doc:` and should end with the path to the
   case-data property. For example `doc:/firstname`.
3. A value retrieved from a process variable. This value should start with `pv:` and should end with the name of the
   process variable. For example `pv:firstname`.
