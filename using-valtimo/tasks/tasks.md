# Tasks

A task view is available for users of Valtimo. 

This view combines tasks from different cases. The available categories are:
- **My tasks:** These are tasks that are assigned to the current user
- **Unassigned tasks:** These tasks are not assigned to any user
- **All tasks** This view shows all tasks regardless of assignment

A user can filter the tasks by case via the top dropdown:

**When no case is selected**, tasks from all cases is shown. 
This view uses the task columns as configured in code. This cannot be changed via the UI.

**When a case is selected**, the tasks are filtered by that case, and the columns as configured for that case are shown. 
For more information on configuring task list columns for a case, click [here](task-list-columns.md)
